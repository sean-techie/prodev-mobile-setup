## Reset Project Observation

When I ran the command `npm run reset-project`, the project was reset to a clean state.

### What happened:
- I was prompted to choose whether to move existing files instead of deleting them.
- After confirming, the existing project files were moved into a newly created `app-example/` directory.
- The default Expo template files were regenerated in the root project directory.
- This allowed me to keep a backup of my previous work while starting with a fresh project setup.

### Purpose:
The reset process helps clean the project environment, remove previous configurations, and restore the default Expo structure without permanently deleting existing files.# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
